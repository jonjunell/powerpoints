### DDI to CCS & DNS for CCS

These are two fun-themed update slides for our monthly "all IT" meeting.  After a number of dry updates, I found it was easier to grab folk's attention with something a little more colorful.  They highlight project updates during the first year of 2021.

### Maintenance and Outage Window

This is a serious presentation that I gave to the IT Advisory Committee at Western Washington University.  This was the first formal meeting for this topic.  Hey!  It got us actual supported maintenance windows.

### PBX Thingie

Again, back to more light hearted presentations.  I wanted to provide an infographic to the monthly update to illustrate how much progress had been made in the PBX migration project.

### CCS Overview

After returning from Ignite 2019, I shared this presentation with two other employees who attended.

### EIS Pitch

When we work with new vendors, its helpful to give them an overview of where we are and our culture.  If I need to sit through their slides about their company, its only equitable that they get to enjoy the same.

### Platform Migration

An overview of the challenges facing our infrastructure and the plan around moving to containers, the cloud and how large complicate on-premise applications are eating up our infrastructure.

### Doubling Down on Cooking Metaphors

We're migrating a number of our Tomcat and single-service web apps to an Azure Stack Hub.  This is the overview presentation to multiple stakeholder groups.  I change _what_ I talk about based on the audience.  Its a fun presentation to give and there's lots of audience engagement around the food pictures.

### A Conversation about Responsibilities

At Educause I attended a panel about M & A in Higher Ed and how building demographic challenges are going to impact our industry _significantly_.  This presentation was about guiding the audience through a discussion about how Western should address future challenges.

### EIS Updates

All about Cool Crab.  Creating engaging content for large meetings has always been a source of enjoyment.  Here's my latest PPT providing updates on current projects and offering guidance on changes in LDAP attributes.
